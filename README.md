# South_Africa_Crop_Comp
Pulled from: [Radiant Earth Spot The Crop Challenge](https://github.com/radiantearth/spot-the-crop-challenge)
The objective of this challenge was to use time-series of Sentinel-2 multispectral data to classify crops in the Western Cape of South Africa. Participants were asked to build a machine learning model to predict crop type classes for the test dataset. The training dataset was generated by the Radiant Earth Foundation team, using the ground reference data collected and provided by the Western Cape Department of Agriculture.

This repository contains the winning models from the regular track of the competition in which participants used time series of Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery as input for crop type classification.

## 🧪 Submitting Your Prediction

To participate, submit a `prediction.csv` file in one of the following formats:

### Option 1: Labels Only
```
crop_name
Lucerne/Medics
Small grain grazing
Barley
Lucerne/Medics
Small grain grazing
Canola
Wheat
```

### Option 2: Labels with Probabilities
```
crop_name,probability
Lucerne/Medics,0.85
Small grain grazing,0.92
Barley,0.78
Lucerne/Medics,0.81
Small grain grazing,0.89
Canola,0.94
Wheat,0.87
```
 
### 📋 Submission Requirements

- File **must be named** `prediction.csv` and provide **field-level predictions**
- Include either:
  - **One column** with header `crop_name`, or
  - **Two columns** with headers `crop_name` and `probability`
- Predictions must be **ordered by field ID** (same order as the provided test data) - or the order of the test data in the `test` folder of the geojson file geometries
- Save your file in:

```
submissions/prediction.csv
```

### ⚙️ What Happens Next

Once your pull request is submitted:
- A GitHub Action will automatically run
- It will compare your predictions to a hidden ground truth
- You'll receive a **Cohen's Kappa**, **F1 score**, and **Cross Entropy** as a comment on your PR
Good luck! 🌾📈

Where Cross Entropy is calculated as:

$J = -\frac{1}{N} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{9} y_{j,i} \ln(p_{j,i}) \right)$
